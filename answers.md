# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization
```
jesseraycrouse@Jesses-MacBook-Pro lab03-exercises % ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   3 jesseraycrouse  staff   96 Sep  4 10:24 .

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output
```
jesseraycrouse@Jesses-MacBook-Pro lab03-exercises % git diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init - this git command creates and initializes a new git repository.
* git status - this git command spits out the current status of files and changes in your current repository.
* git add - this git command adds any changes to the stage for comitting changes.
* git commit - this git command pushes any staged changes onto the repository.
* git log - this command spits out any recent changes and commits that were made to your current repository.
* git diff - this command shows you any differences in the current files in your directory. 


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).
 - DONE!
## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).
 - DONE!

## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
https://github.com/JesseRayCrouse/lab03-exercises/tree/one-set
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.
Create a merge commit - this is the standard merge commit, in which everything from the branch is then merged with main.
Squash and merge - this is similar to the standard merge commit, but it squashes every commit in the pull request into a single commit before merging with main.
Rebase and merge - this option of merging puts the branch you want to merge on top of the main branch, without a merge commit. This way won't work if you have any merge conflicts, which are a pain.
